Instructions

This is an extended and graphical version of the cave backtracking assignment done earlier.
The only user interaction needed for this project is for the user to enter what file
name to use. There are three files that the user can choose from.

1.) cave_sampleA.txt
2.) cave_sampleB.txt
3.) cave_sampleC.txt

Also, the user gets to choose what colors they want to use in the application.
All you have to do is go through each list box and select which color do you want
the corresponding element of the map to have.

After pressing 'Submit', the application will run and the user can watch how the logic is
used within the turtle library.
